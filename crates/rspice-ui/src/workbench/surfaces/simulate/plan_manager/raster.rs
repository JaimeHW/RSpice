//! Deterministic visual regressions for every plan-manager route and gated
//! viewport.
//!
//! The contract tests next door read what the manager paints and how wide it
//! came out; nothing in them sees the result. This runs the real dialog through
//! [`crate::ui::raster`] — headless, software-filled, no GPU, no window, and no
//! dependence on the wasm build.
//!
//! Every route at every gated viewport — the same eight modes and the same
//! three shapes the contract tests gate, taken from
//! [`tests::GATED_VIEWPORTS`](super::tests::GATED_VIEWPORTS) rather than
//! restated, so a render is of the arrangement that was actually asserted
//! about. Each canvas is exactly its viewport: the product rule is that the
//! whole surface fits without scrolling, and a taller canvas would let a
//! surface that overflows the reader's screen look complete here.
//!
//! Read the renders for layout, not for wording — the rasterizer samples the
//! font atlas without filtering, and its own header says what that costs. A
//! glyph read off one of these images is not a defect report; check the string
//! in `tests.rs`, which reads the galley rather than the pixels.
//!
//! The default tests compare reviewed fingerprints and never write files. The
//! ignored review tools print replacement fingerprints or write PNGs to
//! `RSPICE_RASTER_DIR` (default: the system temp directory).

// Native-only, like the render harnesses in `tests.rs` it shares fixtures with:
// it rasterizes to a file for a person to open.
